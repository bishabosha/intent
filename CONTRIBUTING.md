# Contributing to Intent

The design of Intent and the structure of tests is still a moving target.
Therefore, if you wish to contribute, please open an issue or comment on an
existing issue so that we can have a discussion first.

For any contribution, the following applies:

* Tests must be added, if relevant.
* Documentation must be added, if relevant.
* In the absence of style guidelines, please stick to the existing style.
  If unsure what the existing style is, ask! :)
